# ProjectEuler

Bootleg solutions for project euler 1 - 100. No answers provided, so hopefully not breaking the clause below :-)

* _"Note: The rule about sharing solutions outside of Project Euler does not apply to the first 100 problems, as long as any discussion clearly aims to instruct methods, not just provide answers, and does not directly threaten to undermine the enjoyment of solving later problems. Problems 1 to 100 provide a wealth of helpful introductory teaching material and if you are able to respect our requirements, then we give permission for them to be discussed elsewhere."_
